includes the following methods:
1)__init__(self, name, length, location, orientation): this method is the constructor of the objects
in the class (the cars) and gives them their attributes.
2)car_coordinates(self): this method returns the coordinates of a specific car.
3)possible_moves(self): this method return all the possible moves the car can make depends on orientation.
4)movement_requirements(self, movekey): this method returns a list of the coordinate that need to be empty for the car
to move in the direction given.
5)move(self, movekey): this method updates the location of a car to a new location depends on the direction given.
6)get_name(self): this method returns the name of the car.

Class Board:
a class that makes the objects of the board with it's attributes (height,width,car_lst) and includes the
following methods:
1) __init__(self): this methods is the constructor of the objects in the class (the board)
and gives them their attributes.
2)__str__(self): this method prints the board.
3)cell_list(self): this  method returns a list with all the coordinates the board has including the winning coordinate.
4)filled_cells(self): this methods checks all the coordinates that the car occupy and returns the a list of the
coordinates that are occupied on the board.
5)possible_moves(self): this function returns all the possible moves that each car can make depends on the car
orientation and if other cars block their move.
6)target_location(self): this method returns the coordinate that the car needs to get to in order to win.
7)cell_content(self, coordinate): this method checks if the coordinate given is empty returns None if empty
and if its occupied it returns the name of the car that occupies it.
8)add_car(self, car): this method adds a new car to the board.
9)move_car(self, name, movekey): this method recienes a name of a car and a direction and if possible moves
the car on the direction and returns true, if not returns false.

Class Game:

and asks the user for a move, if the move is valid it makes the move and prints the board, if not
returns an error.
